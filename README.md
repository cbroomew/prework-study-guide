# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for building this Prework Study Guide was to gather all my notes for the coding bootcamp prework. I built this project to practice with the various tools we are learning about in this section of the course. It allows me to easily view the topics covered. I've learned that using these tools takes time and practice.

This Prework Study Guide can serve as a starting point for any questions regarding the starting material for this course. Each section contains notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If you are unsure what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
